*eufony/marshaller provides a standard interface for object marshalling libraries.*

[Marshalling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshalling_(computer_science)) is a similar concept to serialization.
Unlike serialization however, marshalling refers to a more general process of preparing the memory representation of an
object into a data format suitable for storage or transmission. *eufony/marshaller* is a PHP library that aims to
improve interoperability between marshalling implementations.
